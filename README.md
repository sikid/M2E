# M2E
It's the code for paper ["Multi-View Multi-Graph Embedding for Brain Network Clustering Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07703.pdf)

To run the code, just execute the following command using Matlab:
```
M2E_demo.m"
```

The dataset is private. So we just provide a random generated dataset "./demo_dataset.mat".
